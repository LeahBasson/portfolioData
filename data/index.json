    "about":[
       "I'm Leah Basson, a 19-year-old from the southern suburbs, with a passion for design and web development. Inspired by my love for technology and Marvel movies, particularly Iron Man, I believe in the limitless possibilities of technology. In 2023, I pursued web development at the College of Cape Town. Despite challenges with math in high school, I worked hard on each project, consistently submitting on time and often achieving top rankings. After College of Cape Town I decided to study further at Life Choices Coding Academy as they offered new languages and professional development. During my time at Life Choices I remained diligent and focused and maintained my rank as top achiever. While I was at Life Choices I did some modeling on the side for a modeling brand called expose and I also joined the girls code hackathon with a team of girls."
